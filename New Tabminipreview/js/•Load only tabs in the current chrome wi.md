•Load only tabs in the current chrome window, and not all the windows
•Clear cache is only an additional option and using it must show a folder with all "Tabs whose Previews are saved"

AFTER IMPLEMENTING PANE FOR TABGroup and BOOKMARKmANAGER RETRIEVEL/REVIEWING:

LAST:
•Smart, Logical "History" (Maybe something like: 'wORK hISTORY')
                         → Also : Record actions (e.g., adding/removing tabs, saving lists) like an undo/redo log, similar to Photoshop.

• Making saving lists as "Workspace", a BETA feature and make saving as TabGroups and Bookmark folders, the default feature.

ACTUALLY NOT REQUIRED TO CREATE NEW LIST, I GUESS:-
••Creating New Lists:
•     Offer multiple methods:
            •Add tabs by entering URLs.
            •Search tabs by name or URL.
            •Add multiple tabs at once (inspired by the Fireshot extension).
            •Import tabs from bookmarks or tab groups.
•Add viewed tabs to a list or save unsaved changes to history.


FUTURE -MAYBE PREMIUM, AFTER RELEASE:

Let users select bookmark folders or tab groups to generate previews for all tabs within them. Previews are temporary, allowing review without permanent storage or opening tabs.

Not SURE:
  ADvanced Grouping:Group tabs by name, source, or content (e.g., topic-related tabs).

GROK SUGGESTIONS:

Final Thoughts
Your plan is both logical and practical, addressing real user needs like decluttering and organization while leveraging Chrome’s ecosystem (bookmarks, tab groups). The key is to prioritize:

Core redesign (interface, saving, temporary previews).
Usability features (history, list creation).
Advanced options (review previews, batch grouping) as enhancements.
